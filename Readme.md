<h3 align="left">About Me</h3>

###

<p align="left">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m HÃ¼seyin
Iâ€™m a senior engineer specializing in DevOps, backend architecture, and AI/ML systems. My work bridges scalable infrastructure, intelligent automation, and data-driven solutions.

Cloud & DevOps: Designing and optimizing resilient cloud environments (AWS), implementing CI/CD pipelines, and managing container orchestration with Kubernetes to ensure operational excellence.

Backend Development: Building and maintaining scalable backend services with frameworks like Django and NestJS, focusing on clean architecture, performance, and seamless integration across environments.

AI & Machine Learning: Developing and deploying models in natural language processing, computer vision, and recommendation systems, leveraging technologies such as YOLO, OpenAI, and vLLM to deliver tangible business impact.

My goal is to create systems that are robust, scalable, and intelligent â€” translating complex requirements into reliable, production-ready solutions.

Focused on delivering value through technology, automation, and strategic design.

Feel free to explore my work and connect.</p>
